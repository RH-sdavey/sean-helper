# We are Sean!
A developer and sysadmin pair, both called... Sean, and we want to help you get into I.T ... no money, no strings attached, we just want to help you to change your life.

# Why do you wanna help me?
We both work in I.T, both coming from other jobs
> Sean; I was a Chef
>
> Sean; I was a Farmer

and now we work for some of the biggest IT companies in the world.
> Sean; I'm a Java Developer, previously QA tester, Sysadmin
>
> Sean; I'm a Sysadmin

we changed our careers in less than 1-2 year, and we believe we can help you to do exactly the same, just follow our tutorials here to learn the skills required to land your first IT job, and in 1 year, you can be in the same position to make a website of your own, to help others, for free.

# So what's the catch?
There's no catch, we don't want your money, we don't need or want anything from you, just some of your time... work hard and improve your skills and give yourself the chance to leave the job you hate to work in IT.

# No really, what's going on?
> Sean; three years ago I was a chef, in a Japanese restaurant in New Zealand and decided to change my life somehow... I started learning website design, and remember being SO confused by the < and > symbols, and what the hell was "\<div class="d-inline-block f5 mr-2 pt-3 pb-2" \>"
>, no idea.
> I persevered and became a Sysadmin, Senior Sysadmin, Network Admin, QA Tester and now Java Developer IN 2 YEARS! I am certified with RHCSA, Ansible, Docker development, Big Data, Networking, Openshift and Kubernetes development and I'm pretty good with a few other things also, git, java, python, javascript etc. around 6 months ago, I met Sean... and decided to help him ( I liked his smile )
