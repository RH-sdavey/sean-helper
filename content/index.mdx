# We are Sean!
A developer and sysadmin pair, both called... Sean, and we want to help you get into I.T ... no money, no strings attached, we just want to help you to change your life.

# Why do you wanna help me?
We both work in I.T, both coming from other jobs
> Sean; I was a Chef
>
> Sean; I was a Farmer

and now we work for some of the biggest IT companies in the world.
> Sean; I'm a Java Developer, previously QA tester, Sysadmin
>
> Sean; I'm a Sysadmin

we changed our careers in less than 1-2 year, and we believe we can help you to do exactly the same, just follow our tutorials here to learn the skills required to land your first IT job, and in 1 year, you can be in the same position to make a website of your own, to help others, for free.

# So what's the catch?
There's no catch, we don't want your money, we don't need or want anything from you, just some of your time... work hard and improve your skills and give yourself the chance to leave the job you hate to work in IT.

# No really, what's going on?
> Sean; three years ago I was a chef, in a Japanese restaurant in New Zealand and decided to change my life somehow... I started learning website design, and remember being SO confused by the < and > symbols, and what the hell was ```"\<div class="d-inline-block f5 mr-2 pt-3 pb-2" \>"```
>, no idea.
> I persevered and became a Sysadmin, Senior Sysadmin, Network Admin, QA Tester and now Java Developer IN 2 YEARS! I am certified with RHCSA, Ansible, Docker development, Big Data, Networking, Openshift and Kubernetes development and I'm pretty good with a few other things also, git, java, python, javascript etc. around 6 months ago, I met Sean... and decided to help him ( I liked his smile )

> Sean; Three years ago I just started working as a window cleaner after being unemployed for nearly 2 years. I came to Brno to visit my then girlfriend and managed to secure an interview at a well known IT company and somehow got the job. I had no career aspirations or goals, I was lost and had no idea what I wanted from life, I was just happy to have a job. Shortly after starting I met Sean who was so enthuasiastic and motivating, he wanted to teach me everything he could. Now 6 months later I am a competant Sysadmin with a range of skills and knowledge eager to pass onto the next person. Sean helped me to realize that my passion was in IT specifically Linux and since then has pushed me to be better and helped me in everyway possible and since that first day I have never looked back. I know and understand things I never even knew existed before and the great part is there is always more to learn. you're always challenging yourself to become better which is a beautiful thing!
