Was thinking of creating a place where we can add our todo list based on ideas and suggestions?
Make homepage more simple and user friendly
Add profile pages for us both to make it a bit more friendly/personal
Maybe add some feedback/survery section?
Discuss what pages we will have on the site (e.g. educational materials, contact, history etc)
Could add some tests or something so people can see how well/effectively they're learning
Discuss how the materials will be structured and what we will cover
Make the website more Linux based (even though the palm tress and waterfalls look cool :))
